# Justified Multicollinearity

When two independent variables are highly correlated but both are necessary for capturing the combined effect on the dependent variable, it can be described as a case where multicollinearity exists but is justified or acceptable due to the need to retain both variables in the model.

Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high correlation between two or more predictor variables, which can make it difficult to isolate the individual effect of each predictor on the outcome. However, in some cases, even when multicollinearity is present, both correlated variables are retained in the model because they represent different aspects of the underlying phenomenon and are necessary to properly understand the relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable.

This is a common issue in regression modeling, where the trade-off between reducing multicollinearity and including necessary variables must be carefully considered.
